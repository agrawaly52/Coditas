## Problem statement

  1) User is searching for Github and GitLab users and their projects using the Github and
    GitLab APIs respectively.
  2) The aim is to consume all the APIs and create a single unified API.
    1. To begin with, you can use either of the provided APIs(Github/GitLab),
    2. However a merge of both the APIs responses as single output is an added advantage
    3. Your API design must allow newer APIs integration.
  3) Along with the searching, fetch only the repositories those are owned by the user
    And using response, one should be able to identify if the project is on Gitlab or Github.
